# Future Plans

Android phones and hoverboard integrations will be explored, it is going to be fun! 

## Acceleromenter/Gyro Control 
The hoverboard needs to follow the phone direction taken from the gyroscope. That would require an estimate of the direction of the hoverboard.

## Remote Control via webrtc
Amazon Chime or other Webrtc solutions can be explorer in order to drive the hoverboard remotely

## Autonomous Control
The new android phone have a built in depth depth camera. Is it feasible to build such a system ?
